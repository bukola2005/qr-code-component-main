### What I learned

i learned how to reset the base font-size of my browser and by using percentage unit has my base font-size. it is esay to change when using media queries 
Calculation on how 1rem is 10px:
 10px/ 16px = 62.5
  this define what 1rem is
  

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
html{
    font-size: 62.5%;
}
@media only screen and (max-width: 600px){
      html{
        font-size: 50%;
    }
   h3{
    font-size: 1.1rem;
   }
   .text-box{
 padding: 0.2rem;
}
.container{
    width: 34%;
    padding: 1rem;
}
p{
    font-size: .9rem;
}
}
```
